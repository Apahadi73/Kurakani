## Features Used:
* flutter_platform_widgets used for better native ui appearance with less code

## Important notes:
* could not add apple notifiicatin push service because I don't have a paid developer account. 
* Push notification works fine on Android though.
* node version 8 has been used since lastest version of node asks for billing account for firebase cloud function used


## side note for developer
* look all the build gradles files having token
* we have a google playlist json file on each android and ios folders
